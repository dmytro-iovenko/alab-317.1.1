## ALAB 317.1.1: Working with TypeScript
This lab will have you work through a list of TypeScript problems to create a TypeScript program that includes classes, unions, literal types, generics, and more. Working through this process is intended to familiarize you with basic TypeScript syntax and techniques, while also providing insights into the similarities between TypeScript and standard JavaScript code. This will enable you to confidently move forward with TypeScript in your future projects.

### Objectives
- Convert an existing JavaScript file into TypeScript.
- Fix existing but unidentified bugs in JavaScript code using TypeScript's editor integration.
- Write TypeScript code from scratch, including:
  - Classes (with Generics).
  - Methods and Functions.
  - Variables.
- Test TypeScript code through simple implementations and basic console logging.
